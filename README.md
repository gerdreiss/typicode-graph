# Typicode JSONPlaceholder API Client

This is an experimental project to explore [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) using

- [Typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as data storage
- [Caliban](https://caliban.io/) as GraphQL server and client library
- [Tyrian](https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/) as a [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/) UI library
